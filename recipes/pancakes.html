        <h2>Fluffy Japanese pancakes. These impressively tall pancakes are great with maple syrup!</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <uL>
            <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </uL>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Butter enough 3 1/2-inch ring molds to fill your frying pan. Place molds in the pan over low heat. Cover.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine buttermilk, egg yolks, butter, and vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Add the flour mixture and stir until batter is fairly smooth.</li>
            <li>Fold egg whites into the batter until combined. Small bits of egg whites still showing is ok.</li>
            <li>Pour about 1/2 cup of batter into each mold and cover the pan. Cook until bubbles start forming at the top, about 5 minutes. Flip pancakes in their molds and cook until set, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
